# AWS Secret Sync

A simple, cost-effective, and self-hosted solution for synchronizing secrets across multiple AWS accounts from a central management account.

## How it Works

This solution uses a "hub-and-spoke" model for secret management:

*   **Hub (Management Account):** A central AWS account hosts the core infrastructure. This includes an AWS Lambda function and a central configuration secret. The secrets that need to be distributed (the "source of truth") also reside in this account.
*   **Spokes (Target Accounts):** Any number of target AWS accounts can receive secrets. They are configured by deploying a simple IAM role named `SecretSyncRole` that trusts the management account's Lambda.
*   **Sync Logic:** The Lambda function runs on a schedule (e.g., once per hour). It reads a central configuration file to identify account groupings, scans for secrets that are tagged for syncing, and then assumes the `SecretSyncRole` in each target account to write the secret values.

## Quick Start

### 1. Deploy Management Account Infrastructure

Deploy the `template.yaml` file located in the `management-account/` directory using the AWS SAM CLI:

```bash
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```

### 2. Setup Target Account Access

In each target account, add the `SecretSyncRole` IAM role.

### 3. Start Syncing Secrets

**Simple approach (no configuration needed):**
Tag any secret in your management account:
- Key: `SecretSync-SyncAccount`
- Value: `123456789012` (target account ID)

**Advanced approach (account groups):**
Create a configuration secret and use group tags.
